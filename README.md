# Load-flow
Author: Md. Nazrul Islam Siddique

In this example, IEEE 4 bus system is considered. However, instead of unbalanced condition, balanced condition is considered i.e. lines are symmetrical and transposed. There are no mutual coupling between the lines. Modified forward backward sweep algorithm is used for the load flow analysis and the results are verified in PSCAD.
